# Online Fraud Detection using Random Forest Classification

## Description
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in online systems by identifying patterns in transaction data.

## Data
The data was obtained from a public, anonymized credit card transactions dataset. The dataset contains credit card transactions from European cardholders in 2013. It is highly unbalanced, with 492 fraudulent transactions out of the 284,807 total transactions.

## Model
The model uses the Random Forest Classification algorithm. This algorithm works by creating a multitude of decision trees and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.

## Training and Testing
The model was trained and tested on a split of the dataset. The parameters used for training include the number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the trees, and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## Usage
To use the model, run the following command:


## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 95%, a precision of 92%, and a recall of 90%.

## Future Work
Future improvements could include trying different algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, or gathering more data.
